# Samuel Adoleh - Web3 Portfolio Website

Hi! This is a simple and clean website for Samuel Adoleh. It's made to show his work as a Web3 Marketing Manager.

## What does it do?

- Looks good on phones, tablets, and computers (responsive!)
- Has a cool typing animation in the hero section
- Sections fade in as you scroll
- The navbar lets you jump to different parts smoothly
- There's a little bar at the top that shows how much you've scrolled

## How to use it

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser. That's it! You don't need to install anything or run any commands.

## Who made this?

This was made by Samuel Adoleh. :)
